# Google_Ceres_Pose_graph_SLAM
Using the Google Ceres Solver to solve the Pose Graph SLAM problem

* Google Ceres Solver is an open source C++ library for modeling and solving large, complicated optimization problems.
* Here, we use the Google Ceres Solver to solve the least square problem which is a part of the Pose Graph SLAM problem.
* The screenshots for the obtained results have been attached as jpg files as well
